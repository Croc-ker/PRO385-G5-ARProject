## Project Description

**AR Asgore Simulator** is an interactive augmented reality experience based on the viral meme where Asgore drinks beers, drives under the influence, and hits Dess. In this simulation, players can move around the AR space, collect and interact with beer bottles, and reenact the comedic meme using real-world tracked surfaces. The experience blends absurdity with technical AR components to deliver a humorous, meme-inspired simulation.
